            <h1>Welcome To My Portfolio</h1>
            <p>My name's Macallan Butler and I'm a Full Stack Web Designer. Please feel free to view my work and get in touch!</p>

        <section id = "about">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m Macallan Butler, a graduate of Arizona State University with a degree in Graphic Information Technology, specializing in full-stack web design. With a passion for UX and SEO, I aim to combine creativity and technical expertise to craft impactful digital experiences.</p>

                <p>Originally from Chicago, I’m a 24-year-old driven by adaptability, loyalty, and a love of exploration. My ultimate professional goal is to establish my own web design and SEO business, empowering small businesses around the world to thrive in the digital space.</p>
                
                <p>One project I’m particularly proud of is my interactive quiz website focused on snow leopard conservation—a project that reflects my commitment to creating meaningful and engaging online experiences, though I recognize there’s always room for improvement.</p>
                
                <p>When I’m not designing or optimizing, I enjoy lifting weights, following the thrilling world of Formula 1, and immersing myself in a good book. Whether collaborating on innovative designs or building SEO strategies, I’m always eager to learn, grow, and make a lasting impact.</p>
